# Lifting Up!

## A workout tracker application

*Lifting Up!* is a fitness app that can be used for your
workouts. With this app, you'll be able to track your progress at
the gym by using a set of features provided, such as:
- Create new workouts, adding exercises as you wish
- Track what exercise you are doing, the weight and number of sets
- Check your workout history

This application is mostly for people who are interested in keeping track of their progress in the gym in order to
optimize their training. Making an app like this interests me because as a person who goes to gym, an application like
this would help me a lot during my workouts.

# Phase 4: Task 2
Oe thing that I would change in my project in order to optimize its functionality is dividing the GUI class into smaller
subclasses that are all connected by a main class. This would benefit code readability, it would make it easier to find
which classes are causing bugs, and it would also facilitate adding  new elements to the GUI if I so desire.
